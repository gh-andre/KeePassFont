#
# This workflow builds a patched up KeePass.exe that uses larger
# font and packages it along with a few more files in an archive
# file, which is uploaded to a GitHub draft release as an asset.
#
# GitHub maintains workflow run numbers per file name. This file
# should be renamed in the new release branch to start a new
# sequence.
